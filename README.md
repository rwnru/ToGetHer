# 她予 ToGetHer

> Together for her, together with you.

「她予」是一款专为女性设计的健康管理平台，无论是记录月经周期、追踪身体变化，还是获取健康建议，「她予」都能成为你的贴心伙伴。除了这些基础功能外，我们聚焦“月经贫困”问题，着力解决日常场景的实时帮助和经期贫困捐助，打造全国首个整合实时求助＋公益捐赠＋购买商城的经期互助平台。

"ToGetHer" is a health management platform designed specifically for women. Whether it's tracking menstrual cycles, monitoring physical changes, or accessing health advice, "ToGetHer" is your trusted companion. We focus on addressing the issue of "period poverty" by providing real-time assistance in daily situations and enabling menstrual product donations. We're building the nation's first menstrual mutual aid platform that integrates real-time help requests, charitable donations, and a product marketplace.


## 网站 Website

我们的网站是一个致力于女性健康与互助支持的综合性平台。平台设有登录系统，用户可进入个人中心，管理自己的购买记录与求助申请。我们还提供互动性强的社区论坛，便于用户交流经验与建议，以及充满爱心的爱心商城，用于公益产品的购买与捐赠。用户不仅可以向全国范围内有需要的人进行捐助，还可以实时发起求助申请（申请求助），共同构建一个充满关怀、互助与行动力的温暖空间。

Our website features a secure login system, a personalized user center (个人中心) where you can manage your purchases and assistance requests, an interactive community forum (社区论坛) for sharing experiences, and a warm-hearted charity marketplace (爱心商城). Users can also donate to others across the country or submit real-time requests for help (申请求助), making it a unique space for connection, support, and action against period poverty.
